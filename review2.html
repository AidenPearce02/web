            <p>
                This is the tale of <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry Potter</a>, an
                ordinary eleven-year-old boy serving as a sort of
                slave for his aunt and uncle who learns that he is actually a wizard and has been invited to attend the
                <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry">Hogwarts School
                    for Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>. Harry is snatched away from his mundane existence by
                <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a>, the groundskeeper for
                Hogwarts, and quickly thrown into a world completely
                foreign to both him and the viewer. Famous for an incident that happened at his birth, Harry makes
                friends easily at his new school. He soon finds, however, that the wizarding world is far more dangerous
                for him than he would have imagined, and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted.
